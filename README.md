* **ListShuffle.py** - A simple example of python functional style list shuffle implementation. One of the  main drawbacks of using python in functional style is that python does not implements optimizations for [tail recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call). In order to circunvent the problem these constructs must be elimitated. A good discussion is presented [here](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com.au/2009/04/final-words-on-tail-calls.html) and a guide for how to eliminate it can be found [here](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com.au/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html).

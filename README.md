PyListShuffle
=============

A simple example of python functional style list shuffle implementation. One of the  main drawbacks of using python in functional style is that python does not implements optimizations for tail recursion optimization. In order to circunvent the problem these constructs must be elimitated. A good guide can be found [here](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com.au/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html)
